I need you to analyze my codebase and create a comprehensive AI-friendly documentation structure similar to what I use in
other projects. This will help AI assistants understand and navigate the codebase effectively.
STEP 1: Analyze the Project
First, explore the codebase to understand:
Project type (web app, API, library, CLI tool, etc.)
Technology stack and frameworks
Directory structure
Key business domains
External integrations
Testing approach
Development workflow
STEP 2: Create CLAUDE.md
Create a CLAUDE.md file in the project root that serves as the AI assistant's entry point. Include:
A greeting instruction (e.g., "ðŸš€ CLAUDE.MD LOADED")
Project overview (what it does, who uses it, core workflow)
Your role definition for the AI
Common tasks quick reference (5-10 most frequent development tasks)
Essential commands (setup, test, lint, deploy)
Core architecture principles
Link to detailed documentation in /docs/ai/
Any project-specific instructions or constraints
STEP 3: Create Documentation Structure
Create a /docs/ai/ directory with this structure:
docs/ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ 00-index.md          # Navigation hub and project overview
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-overview.md       # Business context and user flows
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-architecture.md   # System design and tech stack
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-conventions.md    # Coding standards and patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ 04-runbook-dev.md    # Development commands and workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ 05-testing.md        # Testing guidelines and structure
â”œâ”€â”€ 06-security.md       # Auth, authorization, data protection
â”œâ”€â”€ 07-glossary.md       # Domain terminology
â”œâ”€â”€ domains/             # Deep dives into business domains
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [domain1].md    # e.g., users, payments, etc.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [domain2].md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ adr/                 # Architecture Decision Records
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 0001-[decision].md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts/             # AI development patterns
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ development-partner.md
â””â”€â”€ workflows/           # Process documentation
â””â”€â”€ project-management.md
STEP 4: Document Content Guidelines
For 00-index.md, include:
Project purpose (one sentence)
Core subsystems list
Technology stack details
External integrations
Key directories with descriptions
Navigation links to other docs
For domain files, document each with:
Overview
Core models/entities
Key services/business logic
API endpoints (if applicable)
Database schemas
Common operations
Testing patterns
For architecture files, cover:
System boundaries
Data flow diagrams (as text/ASCII)
Infrastructure components
Deployment architecture
Performance considerations
STEP 5: Code-Level Documentation
For key directories (models, services, controllers, etc.), add README.md files explaining:
Directory purpose
Common patterns used
Naming conventions
Examples of proper implementation
STEP 6: Integration Points
Document external services in appropriate locations:
API integrations
Third-party libraries
Environment variables
Configuration requirements
Output Requirements:
Start by exploring the codebase thoroughly
Create all files with proper markdown formatting
Use code examples from the actual codebase
Include file paths in documentation (e.g., app/models/user.rb)
Add cross-references between related documentation
Keep descriptions concise but comprehensive
Focus on what AI assistants need to know to be effective
Special Instructions:
Analyze the project's README first if it exists
Look for existing documentation to incorporate
Check for configuration files (package.json, Gemfile, requirements.txt, etc.)
Identify the testing framework and document test patterns
Note any CI/CD configuration
Document environment setup requirements
Include common troubleshooting scenarios
Please analyze my project and create this documentation structure. Start by exploring the codebase, then create the CLAUDE.md
file, followed by the docs/ai/ structure with all relevant documentation.
