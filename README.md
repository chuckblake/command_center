# Command Center: AI-Driven Documentation System

A Rails-based system that uses structured prompts to generate comprehensive technical documentation and reviews automatically.

## 🎯 Concept

Instead of manually writing documentation that gets stale, this system uses carefully crafted prompts to generate consistent, thorough reports by analyzing your actual codebase. Think of it as "documentation as code" but powered by AI.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Structured Prompts**: Detailed prompts in `/prompts/` define exactly what to analyze and how to report it
2. **AI Analysis**: AI tools examine your actual codebase using the prompts as guidance
3. **Markdown Reports**: Generated reports are saved as timestamped Markdown files
4. **Rails Display**: Simple Rails controllers display the reports with file selection

## 📋 Available Review Types

- **System Review** (`cc_system_review.md`) - Code quality, architecture, infrastructure health
- **Security Review** (`cc_security_review.md`) - PII encryption, OWASP Top 10, authentication
- **Test Coverage** (`cc_test_coverage_review.md`) - Model/service test gaps, quality assessment  
- **Integrations** (`cc_integrations.md`) - External APIs, OAuth, third-party services
- **Gem Reviews** (`cc_gem_review_pundit.md`) - Maintenance-focused gem analysis
